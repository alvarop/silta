===Silta - Python to STM32F4 Bridge Project===

Python library and STM32F4 Discovery firmware to control the microcontroller's GPIOs and serial interfaces directly from python. This allows for intefacing with external devices quickly without having to write any firmware!

Currently supported interfaces:
I2C1
GPIOs (A-E)
SPI1

Future support (hopefully):
I2C2-3
SPI2+
ADC
DAC
UART

--Build instructions

Make sure you have the arm-none-eabi(gcc, etc...) tools installed: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Running make on the top directory should build both the driver library, support files, and main.c
Output files are in the build/ directory

--Programming instructions (using openOCD and gdb)

Connect using openOCD and the included configuration file.
$ openocd -f stm32f4xx-openOCD.cfg

On a separate terminal window, run arm-none-eabi-gdb
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb 

Connect to openOCD
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333

Load program the stm32f4xx
(gdb) file build/silta.elf
(gdb) load

To run you program:
(gdb) continue
